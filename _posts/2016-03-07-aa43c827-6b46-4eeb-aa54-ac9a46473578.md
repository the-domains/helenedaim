Work With Me

Hi I'm Helene Daim -

I used to own my own beauty shop where I provided treatments to help my clients get healthy skin. I really loved my work and I worked hard. 

I became Norway's top salesperson for the product line I sold. And after seven years of working, working, working and not listening to the signals of my body I lost all of my passion and love for the beauty industry. I was completely burned out. ****

Now fast forward to my current life

... I am traveling the world, eating food that supports my health and body and I feel at peace. I am enjoying life and I feel at ease because I listen to my body and make choices that support me and my well being. I now know what it really means to take care of myself, my business, my partner, my friendships and to create balance in my life.

So how do I do it? I learned to really listen to my body. 

I created Be Happy By Being Yourself because I know there are so many of you who are living imbalanced lives and your health is suffering...but you don't have to live like that any more. I have helped people from all over the world reconnect and learn to enjoy life. I've watched my clients find security. They feel whole, and they have mastered making small, yet important choices that lead them to have a balanced work- life, good health and most importantly -a happy life. An you can have this too.
